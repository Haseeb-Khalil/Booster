* See Here: https://cyf-booster.herokuapp.com
* An energiser application which helps Code Your Future trainees to host/Join energisers in an effortless way during the class. 

# How To use ?

* As Host: 
If you're willing to host an energiser for your team, you can visit the application here: https://cyf-booster.herokuapp.com and choose one from our popular energisers. You can click on "host" or "create game" button which take to you all energisers where you can sort them according to your preference to find the right energiser or you can search for an energiser. Once you click "host now" full details of energiser fifteen minutes timer and a "share code" (for example: "y5hbDTU") will appear. You can share the application link: https://cyf-booster.herokuapp.com and "share code" with your team to let them join you on the same energiser. You should be able to see how many people are online.

* As User: 
If you're trying to join a game you can open the application link: https://cyf-booster.herokuapp.com and paste the "share code" (for example: "y5hbDTU") which is shared by your host into join now field and join the host on the same energiser. You should be able to see the time left for the energiser, description and playing instructions. If you enjoy the energiser give it a like.

# Why we made Booster App?

* At CodeYourFuture, we run lots and lots of meetings, often with people who don’t know each other well or at all. We begin our meetings with an energiser  - a game to get the group together. But because we have so many meetings, it can get hard to think of all these energisers and it’s hard to know which are good.

# What problem does it solve?

* This application helps CodeYourFuture trainees to host and join energisers effortlessly. 
* Thanks to a share code feature which helps gather users on same page. 
* Most importantly it keeps track of energiser time so you don't run over.

# What did we(The Unstoppables) learn?

Our team called "The Unstoppables" worked in period of Four weeks to create an MVP. 
* As this was our first project as a team, we learned how to work in a team to deliver an MVP in given time frame. 
* We worked using agile methodologies to reach our goal. We divided our time-frame into four sprints. 
* We had daily stand-ups to track our daily progress and to unblock any blockers. 
* We had weekly backlog refinement meetings to keep track of our application's backlog and what to priorities. 
* We had Retrospective meetings at the start of each sprint to make sure what and how it can be improved.
* We used Trello, Github board to keep track of our progress and write user stories. 
* We used google forms to do user research.
* We learned new technologies like: Material-Ui, Socket-io


# Features

Some of the main features of application are below.

* Timer: During energisers in our classes we felt that it can be very hard to keep up with time while playing an energiser. Thanks to timer in our application which helps both users and host to keep track of time. Timer starts when host clicks to host an energiser. It is synced for both users and host and users can not change it.

* Popular Energisers: Thanks to the slider on the home page which lets see/host the top ten popular energisers based on their likes in our application. It is a very convenient and time saving way of finding a good energiser. 

* Share Code: When a Host clicks an energiser it starts the energiser time displays the full description, playing instructions and a random share code for each time(only visible on host screen). Which can be shared with users to join the host for the same energiser. It is there to help both host and users read the instructions carefully on their own screen.

* Like and Dislike: Both host and user are able to see likes and dislikes of an energiser and use them to vote for the energiser they enjoyed.

* Search, Sort: While looking for an energiser it can be time consuming to find the right energiser. Search and Sort functionality is there to help you find the right energiser for hosting. Energisers can be searched by words included in their title and can be sorted by an alphabetical or most popular order.

* Number of people online: When you host or join an energiser you should be able to see the number of people online.
